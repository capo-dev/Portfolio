### üõ†Ô∏è [Honeynet in Azure](https://github.com/capo-dev/SOC-Honeynet-in-Azure)
**Category**: Cybersecurity  
**Technologies**: Azure, Microsoft Sentinel, Log Analytics, SecurityEvent, Syslog, Syslog  
**Description**:  
In this project, I built a mini honeynet in Azure to simulate an insecure environment and monitor security events. Logs were ingested into Log Analytics, processed by Microsoft Sentinel, and used for attack maps, alerts, and incidents. I measured security metrics before and after hardening the environment.

### üõ°Ô∏è Building Incident Response Playbooks: A Comprehensive Guide
This project is designed to help security professionals create comprehensive **Incident Response Playbooks**. It offers a step-by-step methodology to assist organizations in drafting customized playbooks for different types of security incidents. Whether dealing with **phishing attacks**, **ransomware**, or **insider threats**, this guide provides detailed playbooks and actionable insights to help security teams respond effectively and mitigate risks.  

The playbooks address key incidents like:

- **Phishing Attacks**  
- **Ransomware**  
- **Data Breaches**  
- **DDoS Attacks**  
- **Insider Threats**  
- **Cloud Misconfigurations**

The project emphasizes building flexible, actionable playbooks that can be tailored to different organizational environments. By following the methodology provided, organizations can ensure a robust response to incidents, reduce potential damage, and recover swiftly from attacks.
